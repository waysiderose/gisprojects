# Final Project

As a privacy professional, I want to highlight how geolocation tracking data is collected by commonly used apps so that users can increase their understanding and make more informed decisions.

## Problem Statement

There is a lack of understanding in the general population around data collection and agreements. Few understand what they agree to share, how personal information is collected, and how that data is used. As many of 91% of US adults agree to a Terms of Service without reading in full and a full 4 in 5 click through the Privacy Policy. When it comes to understanding how their data is used, the numbers are just as low: only 6% of American say they greatly understand how companies use their information.

There are both benefits and risks involved in data collection, especially when it comes to your location. While itâ€™s convenient to find the nearest Starbucks with a few taps, it also means there exists a record of your travel patterns and routine.
