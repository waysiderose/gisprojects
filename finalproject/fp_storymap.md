# Final Deliverable: StoryMap

My final deliverable for my final project was a StoryMap published to the public. I also delivered each piece included in this story map as individual pieces so that the "project sponsor" would be able to reassemble the deliverable on other platforms.

A link to the StoryMap can also be found [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/fea39d901cf1431184252802f33af9be).
