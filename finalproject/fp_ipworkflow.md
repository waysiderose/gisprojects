# Final Project Workflow Example

Open source or free data sets of location information are few and far between. Based on limited availability, I created my own data sets for two of the four map projections I used in my final project deliverable.

## Step 1. Create list of random IP addresses.

I used the [Random IP Address Generator](https://www.ipvoid.com/random-ip/) to create a list of 10 random IP addresses.

## Step 2. Identify IP addresses.

I used the [IP Locator](https://websiteseochecker.com/ip-location/) to identify the city, state, and countries the IP addresses came from. I also identified the lattitude and longitude.

## Step 3. Create the data set.

I created a table with the IP addresses, location, lattitude, and longitute. The examples above do not show the exact data I used to create my map.

Here is the completed data set:

| IP Address      | Location                              | Latitude | Longitude |   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|----------|-----------|---|
| 139.80.237.224  | Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand           | -45.8784 | 170.5201  |   |
| 154.27.233.254  | Dowagiac, Michigan, United States     | 41.9943  | -86.1159  |   |
| 53.16.13.69     | Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany | 48.7863  | 9.2381    |   |
| 29.127.142.230  | Whitehall, Ohio, United States        | 39.9747  | -82.8947  |   |
| 62.237.150.253  | Rauma, Satakunta, Finland             | 61.1309  | 21.5059   |   |
| 48.246.27.7     | Newark, New Jersey, United States     | 40.7369  | -74.172   |   |
| 97.168.74.232   | New York, New York, United States     | 40.7128  | -74.006   |   |
| 208.66.77.249   | Woodbury, Connecticut, United States  | 41.5511  | -73.2153  |   |
| 215.130.235.139 | Whitehall, Ohio, United States        | 39.9747  | -82.8947  |   |
| 110.65.254.8    | Chongshan, Hainan, China              | 18.7771  | 109.52    |   |

## Step 4. Use the data set in a visualization.

I used the above data set to simulate coarse location information collected by Zoom, which only collects and saves IP address location information.

This data was then visualized in a Dashboard using ArcGIS Insights.
