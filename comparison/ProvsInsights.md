# Comparing Capabilities: ArcGIS Pro versus ArcGIS Insights

There are multiple tools that can be used to solve GIS problems. It's important to know the strengths and weaknesses of the software we use in order to choose the right one for the right approach.

Esri has a few products under the ArcGIS series. One is classic ArcGIS, another is ArcGIS Pro, or ArcGIS Insights. There are different versions and ways to use the software as well. This time, we are comparing ArcGIS Pro to ArcGIS Insights.

## Decision Summary

Both ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Insights are strong data and spatial analysis software. However, at the end of the day Pro is more powerful and Insights is easier to use.

If the problems you want to solve require a high amount of spatial analysis or spatial data customization, go with Pro.

If your challenges lie more with data visualization or data exploration and sharing, go with Insights.
