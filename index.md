## About Me
Welcome to my Advanced GIS online portfolio. I'm a 2019 graduate of Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College of Public Policy and Management who currently works for the university's Software Engineering Institute.

My projects are centered at the intersection of my three major passions: communication, data/analysis, and public good.

This is an online portfolio of my work from Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Spring 2021. We're learning to do some very cool things with maps. My goal is to keep my old skills sharp, learn new approach and uses of open-source software, and create a diverse portfolio. There are many ways to approach complex problems and having a diverse set of tools in your problem solving tool box is an important way in finding a solution.
            
## What I Have to Learn

I have a lot to learn about data analytics, AI/ML, data visualization, and all ways to use GIS. I'm particularly interested in learning about open-source software options. I'm familiar with big name brands like ArcGIS Pro and Talbeau, but licensing isn't always an option.

I also have much to learn about science communication and data visualization. While I have experience translating complex topics and presenting information in person, it's a whole other story in text and graphics.
